# Psychic-Game

## What It Is:
This is a letter-guessing game built with JavaScript.

## Gameplay:
The game begins with the computer picking a random letter.  The user (you) must then guess what that letter is.  User is given 10 attempts to guess the computer's letter.  If the user guesses the correct letter, the victory is tallied in the Wins counter and the game resets (new letter is chosen, number of guesses counter reset to 10).  If the user is unable to guess in the 10 attempts, the loss is tallied in the Loss counter and the game resets, as mentioned above.
